/**
 * Use this method to send audio files, if you want Telegram clients to display them in the music player. Your audio
 * must be in the .mp3 format. On success, the sent Message is returned. Bots can currently send audio files of up to
 * 50 MB in size, this limit may be changed in the future.
 *
 * For backward compatibility, when the fields title and performer are both empty and the mime-type of the file to be
 * sent is not audio/mpeg, the file will be sent as a playable voice message. For this to work, the audio must be in an
 * .ogg file encoded with OPUS. This behavior will be phased out in the future. For sending voice messages, use the
 * sendVoice method instead.
